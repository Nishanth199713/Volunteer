# Volunteer
Developed a Volunteer Management System Web App using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. MySQL is being used to store the data in the database.There are four different kinds of users: Student/Volunteer, Professor, Site Administrator/Department and Admin.All the users have a login/register page. Once Logged in the students can apply to work for a professor by a filling up a “Student / Volunteer Registration form”. Professors will be able to view the list of applied students and they can recruit them. They must wait for the department approval for assigning tasks. The department can view the list of students that were forwarded by the Professors and they can either approve or reject them. The admin has the access to delete/update users from the volunteer management system.
